# Data-Pre-processing-in-Machine-Learning
## Problem Statement
Using Big Mart Sales, data scientists gathered 2013 sales data for 1559 commodities across ten locations in many cities. Additionally, certain characteristics of each product and retailer have been determined.
Data pre-processing and feature engineering will be performed to prepare the dataset before it is used by the machine learning model.
## Objectives
The objectives of this projects are:
* Perform initial data exploration.
* Perform data pre-processing.
* Perform hypothesis testing (statistical and non-statistical) in cleaned data set.
* Perform feature engineering (one-hot encoding, label encoding, and binning).
## About the dataset.
* 5 categorical variables
* 5 continuous variables
* 1 variable to accommodate the Item identifier (ID)
* 1 variable to accommodate the Outlet identifier (ID)
## Libraries Used
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
